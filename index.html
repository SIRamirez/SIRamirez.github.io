			<h3> Why Travel?</h3>
			<p>
			Accoding to a nine-year study, involving 12,000 men, those who took vacation at least once a year were 30% less likely to die from heart disease. In another study made in 2005 on 15,000 women, showed that traveling significantly lowered the risk of depresion. 
			Traveling is also good for one's mind. Studies have shown that travelers had lower levels of stress hormones. Employees interview who have noted they travel for vacation had lower rates of absenteeism, higher productivity levels and felt less burnt outs. Traveling is also good for relationships. Its shown that travel brings people together to building lifelong memories. </br>
